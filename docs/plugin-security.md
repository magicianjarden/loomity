# Plugin Security Architecture

## Sandboxing
- Isolated execution environment using Web Workers
- Restricted access to DOM and global objects
- Memory and CPU usage limits
- Network request filtering

## Permission System
- Fine-grained permission model
- Required permissions declaration in plugin manifest
- Runtime permission checks
- User approval for sensitive operations

## Code Signing & Verification
- Digital signatures for plugin packages
- Certificate-based trust chain
- Integrity verification on installation and updates
- Automatic signature validation

## Security Audit Tools
- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Runtime behavior monitoring
- Security compliance checks

## Resource Usage Limits
- CPU usage throttling
- Memory allocation caps
- Network bandwidth restrictions
- Storage quota enforcement

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Each plugin runs in a dedicated Web Worker
2. Communication through postMessage only
3. Strict CSP policies
4. Capability-based security model
5. Resource monitoring and automatic suspension
