# Project Reference

## Cloud Platform Options

1. **AWS Free Tier**: Amazon Web Services offers a free tier with limited usage of various services like EC2, S3, and RDS for the first 12 months. It's a great way to explore AWS services without incurring costs.

2. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Free Tier**: GCP provides a free tier with a set amount of resources per month. Additionally, they offer $300 in credits for new users, which can be used over the first 90 days.

3. **Microsoft Azure Free Account**: Azure offers a free account with access to popular products for 12 months, a $200 credit for the first 30 days, and access to more than 25 products that are always free.

4. **Heroku**: Known for its simplicity, Heroku offers a free tier with limited resources. It's ideal for deploying small applications quickly.

5. **Vercel**: Specializes in frontend hosting and provides a generous free tier for static sites and serverless functions.

6. **Netlify**: Offers a free tier that includes hosting for static sites and serverless functions with features like continuous deployment from Git.

## Backend Development Ideas
- **Framework**: Next.js
  - A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- **Language**: TypeScript
  - Provides static typing and better tooling support.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Supabase
  - A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
- **ORM**: DO NOT USE ORM ****Preferred not to use ORM***
  - An ORM that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7, ES8).

## Frontend
- **Framework**: NextJS
  - A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **Language**: TypeScript
  - Provides static typing and better tooling support.


## Additional Tools
- **Containerization**: Docker ****Preferred not to use Docker***
  - For packaging applications and their dependencies into a container.
- **Testing**: Jest
  - A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.

## Deployment
- **Vercel**: Platform for frontend hosting for initial deployment.
- **FuturePlatform**: AWS or Heroku
  - Consider AWS for scalability and flexibility or Heroku for ease of use and quick deployment.

## DevOps
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
  - Automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.

## AI Features to Prioritize

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Implement features like text summarization, sentiment analysis, and language translation to enhance user interaction.

2. **Task Automation**: Use AI to automate repetitive tasks, such as scheduling, reminders, and data entry.

3. **Smart Search**: Enhance search capabilities with AI to provide more relevant and personalized results.

4. **Content Generation**: Use AI to help users generate content, such as notes, documents, or project plans.

## Community Building Strategies

1. **Open Source Contributions**: Encourage contributions by providing clear guidelines and recognizing contributors.

2. **Community Forums**: Establish forums or Discord channels for users to discuss features, report bugs, and share ideas.

3. **Extension Marketplace**: Allow users to create and share extensions, fostering a community of developers.

4. **Regular Updates and Engagement**: Keep the community engaged with regular updates, newsletters, and interactive sessions like webinars or Q&A.

## Notes
- Ensure all services are well-documented and follow best practices for security and performance.
